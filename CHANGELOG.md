## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0-alpha.29] - 2022-01-18

### Fixed

- Don't set refs to undefined in component or element ref collections that stay in the DOM.


## [1.0.0-alpha.28] - 2021-12-09

### Added

- Add `propType.any`
- Fix `propType.object.defaultValue` to allow receiving function value

### Fixed

- Don't re-create ref components when previously created globally
- Fix `attr` source conversion
- Improve `bindMap` and other bindings after `bindTemplate` updates
- Fix some internal typing issues that were causing build error
- Check current HTML value before setting innerHTML
- Improve performance with global MutationObserver

### Changed

- Upgrade `vue/reactivity` and `vue/runtime-core` to `3.2.22`
- Improve types for prop `source` options
- Improve error reporting for invalid refs

### Misc

- Add example stories
- Update docs
- Exclude type test files in Jest
- Update Arrays for refs/elements to ReadonlyArray
- Change target for ESM builds to es6 to be more modern

## [1.0.0-alpha.27] - 2021-05-16

### Added
- Add validation on component bindings that try to set props that don't exist.
- Add an `ignoreGuard` option to all `ref` helpers to bypass the default child-component guard.
- Add support for passing multiple components to `refComponent` –
  e.g. `refComponent([Button, Link], { ref: 'some-button' })`.
- Make the `defaultValue` on props actually do something, setting the value when no other
  "error" case is triggered.

### Fixed

- Fix incorrect invalid binding warnings, showing logs in the console that were not correct.
- Prevent refs on collections to update when "inner" HTML updates, causing bindings to re-apply
  without cleanup.
- Apply `validation` (correctly) on all variations of how to pass props. Don't run validation on
  `undefined` values.

### Misc

- Fix small errors in docs
- Update `refs` API docs to be accurate, and add more examples
- Reorganize and add more Stories for testing
- Add more unit tests


## [1.0.0-alpha.26] - 2021-03-31

### Added
- Add `minimumItemsRequired` option to collection refs –
  e.g. `refCollection('item', { minimumItemsRequired: 3 })`.
- Support `null` in predicates for any type

## [1.0.0-alpha.25] - 2021-03-30

### Changed

- Refactor the propType generation and typing

  Drastically reducing the generated TS declarations (was over 96000 lines)
  to only 60 by using Generics.

  Also set a fixed order of setters in the chaining API, while still allowing
  omitting helpers in the middle.

  `propType.[type].[optional / defaultValue].[validate].[source]`
  `propType.func.[optional].[shape]`

### Misc

- Add unit tests for props

## [1.0.0-alpha.18] - 2021-03-19

  creation".

### Added

- Allow `event` bindings on component `refs`

## [1.0.0-alpha.16] - 2021-03-17

## [1.0.0-alpha.14] - 2021-03-16

### Added

- Add new `bindings`; `checked`, `html`, `style`, `text`, `textInput` and `value`.

- Add new `bindings`; `hasFocus`, `enable/disable`, `visible/hidden` and `submit`.
- [types] Improve the types of refs/bindings

### Changed

- Introduced a "global" `App` using `createApp` as a starting point.

  This will "replace" the `mount` and `registerGlobalComponents`, and other things
  that were kind of global / settings.

- Change lifecycle hooks to mimic the Vue structure a bit more, and get rid of external
  eventEmitter dependency.

### Misc

- Updated the folder structure to match the almost final shape of the API.
- Add some unit tests, and include babel in those tests to get everything working again.
- Introduce "component instances" for `refs` to support devtools, keeping track of bindings and
  when they update.
- Add devtools support, highly inspired by the Vue Devtools.
